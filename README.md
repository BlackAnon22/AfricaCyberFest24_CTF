# AfricaCyberFest24_CTF
This repo contains the writeup for the 2024 [AfricaCyberFest](https://twitter.com/AfricaCyberFest) competition.

The writeups were compiled by participants of the CTF (primarily from the first solver of each challenge) and the unsolved challenge writeups were added by the hosts
