Lets download the file and check the content

That looks like binary but then that's a lot of space, well from experience I can tell that I'm meant to use ```stegsnow``` to solve this hehe

To install this tool you can use the command ```sudo apt install stegsnow```

To use the tool

command:```stegsnow -C simple.txt```

```

‚îî‚îÄ$ stegsnow -C simple.txt
√ÄC√í√î{1√≤√±_j√≥57_√†5_5√®√¨√Ø√´3_4√±_1√≤_100√™5!!!}
```
Now, that's some weird cipher, that's what I thought at firstüòÇ. 

But then, this is actually not a cipher hehe, it is an encoding, it's called a cyrillic encoding

We can decode this using this [webpage](https://2cyr.com/decode/?lang=en)

You can see we have some weird output, now lets select the "source encoding" and also the "displayed as" option

Now, we have a more resonable output

I was actually stuck here for a while because I thought this guy ```–êC–¢–§{1—Ç—Å_j—É57_–∞5_5–∏–º–ø–ª3_4—Å_1—Ç_100–∫5!!!}``` was an encoding but then I thought wrong, it's actually a language lool.

We can translate this using google translator

Yup, that's our flag hehe

FLAG:-```ACTF {1ts_ju57_a5_5impl3_4s_1t_100k5!!!}```
